            <p class="lead">My first memory of the Sims was when I was 8 years old. I played the game on an old Gameboy
                Advance. I fell in love with being able to create my own life, and have it anyway I want. Now, I am a 23
                year old Simmer, and a computer programmer. I wrote the code of this website!S</p> <br>
            <p>This website will be
                dedicated towards my Sims' stories, as well as post my Youtube videos</p>
